    <h3 class="two-column">Our Mission</h3>
    <p class="two-column left">Rewoven is a sustainable fashion company that commissions people to give us their jeans that are out of trend, don’t fit, or need mending and make them into customized statement pieces for the user. Through our textile designer Jessica’s personal artistic lens you will see your old well loved jeans be transformed and rewoven into your life. We understand many people put a lot of care and love into their clothing and we want to help you love those pieces again and make them a stable in your wardrobe. </p>

 <h3 class="two-column">Our Story</h3>
    <p class="two-column left">In 2025 Bella, Jessica, and Lily (our founders) started rewoven during their senior year at CU Boulder. 
        While discussing how they could weave together their interests in beating fast fashion, sustainability, and 
        customization rewoven was born. As the idea began to pick up steam as they threw around ideas and what they wished 
        they could do. Each of them had countless pairs of jeans they didn't wear anymore and were debating donating. 
        They wished they could have a service that made their jeans feel wearable and personal again and decided 
        they could make this wish come true. This wish was rewoven.
