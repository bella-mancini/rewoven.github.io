<h3 class="two-column left">Ian St. Clair</h3>
<p class="two-column left">Ian got his jeans from Berlin, and loved them for many years. 
    They were one of the first pairs of mens jeans he bought, and have important meaning 
    to him and his journey. After many years of wearing them, Ian’s jeans started to fall apart. 
    There are holes on the inner thighs, and he can no longer wear them. They’re a sentimental piece for him, 
    and he sent them to Rewoven to be made wearable and fashionable for him again. </p>

<h3 class="two-column left">Mei White</h3>
<p class="two-column left">Mei’s jeans are a hand me down from her girlfriend.
     Though they fit her well around the waist, she’s always found them too long and 
     was never able to wear them. She wants to practice more sustainable fashion, so 
     rather than throwing away the jeans she sent them to Rewoven to be repaired and customized.  </p>

<h3 class="two-column left">Elijah Heslop</h3>
<p class="two-column left">Elijah got his jeans the first time he went 
    thrifting with his friend. They were a pair of jeans he wore often 
    and loved, but eventually found that the style no longer suited him. 
    They fell out of his fashion rotation. Instead of throwing them away, 
    Elijah sent them to Rewoven to be remade into a new pair of trendy 
    jeans that can re-enter his daily fashion.</p>
